# panel
Übungsprogramm für Steuerung durch ButtonClick
This is an exercise for early VB programming students aged about 13 years. The task is, to make
panels move in different directions as soos as a start button is clicked. We also added a back
buttom (zurück in german) to make the squares move back to the original position.

The most interesting part was, to run this with only one routine and to use 
mathematics to solve the problem instead of having tow routines - one for start and one for back.
